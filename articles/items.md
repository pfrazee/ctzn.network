## How do we manage "value?"

What is value?

It may mean:

- How much people want something (preference)
- How trusted a person is (authority)
- How rare something is (exclusivity)
- An aggregate of these things (wealth)

Managing value is hard. Editors spend hours curating wikis, and social networks build algorithms to elevate valuable content. Software startups define themselves by their answer to this.

In CTZN, we needed a solution which fits our decentralized design. Value needs to be customizable for user-built algorithms. It also needs to be clear to users how value and the algorithms work as they move through user-built communities. If you're looking for a hype-phrase, it's this: we needed a "programmable form of value."

## Managing value through Virtual Items

"Virtual Items" are a simple way to convey value. They are easy to recognize as a currency, a score, a badge, a game-like weapon, etc. They are also consistent across communities; once a user understands items, they can quickly understand a community by looking at how it uses items.
